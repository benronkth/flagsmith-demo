# Flagsmith
Flagsmith lets developers manage software features in order to obtain Staged Feature Rollouts, detect bugs easier and perform A/B Testing. It lets developers test the new features of the software on a small group of users and depolying them later to all of the users. This helps to detect bugs in the software which might not have been detected during the development. Flagsmith also allows A/B testing. By enabling the different sets of features to different sets of users, developers can analys users reactions to different features and thus choose the features that suits best in the final version of the software. 

# Demo
This repo includes a shopping website where some of the Flagsmith features have been presented as a demo.

The concept: Students prepare a demonstration involving DevOps technology, to be performed during the lecture. For example, a demo typically involves multiple virtual machines, likely deployed in the cloud. A demonstration is scripted, prepared and lasts 5 minutes.

To pass, you must have at least 7 "yes".

tASKS:
- [ ] write the goal of feature flags and why does this matter for programmers. Write what it is.
- [ ] write a good script with plans and steps.

## in the script:

benfits of using flagsmith in mobile applications
- Feature Flags really come into their own when managing the features of a mobile application. If you ship a bug in your mobile app, there is a significant time delay in getting a fix onto your user's device:

- You have to wait for App/Play Store approval (although this time period has got much better in recent years)
- Once your new app version is live, you then have to wait for your users to upgrade their application, which could take weeks or even months.

flag examples in mobile applications:
Platform (iOS or Android)
Platform Version (e.g. Android 11, iOS 14)
Your Application Version (this would be the version number you ship your app as - generally the one that shows up in the App/Play Store)


example of a bug on subset of devices:
We've done the hard work and isolated which precise subset of users are affected by this issue. We want the feature to continue to show and work for all our other users (in this case Android users and iOS users on versions older than 5.4.0), but we want to disable it for the affected users.


- [ ] make a good looking website
- [ ] a summary


What we need:
- [ ] 2 users to do AB testing
- [ ] dark mode or design change for a specific segment
- [ ] different color and position change of an elements, like or buy button to see how many people react to it (AB testing)
- [ ] alpha beta users and environment
